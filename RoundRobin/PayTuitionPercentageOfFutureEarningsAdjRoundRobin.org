* PM
- Students take debt, pay up frunt, % of income. People are paying what they are earning
- Justified -> College uncertain, unexpected place, prioritize for whom that is
  the worst.
- People are far more educated, Unin is uncertainty, business cycle really
  uncertain, unlikely to go to certain jobs, rate of technology growth, 21th century
- You dont know how well you are going to college, really low wage job you dont
  havce to pay
- People get far more freedom to choose, people dont go to socially utile, low
  wages, just go to high profitable
- Socially utile jobs, personaly liberate, add value to individual lifes,
  academia, socailly fulfiling, optimizing people way to survive
- Debt burdens -> No job at any given moment -> You pay debt
- Individuals can easly go bankrupt, vital things, like home, assets.
- Poor credit history, cant get credit, get education again
- Cut massively on spending, you cant specialize fully, more specific education
* LO
- Tuition is total amount of pay you are paying for atending university
- What they are supporting is not the total amount, is paying in smaller
  percentage, over a long period of time
- They have to support paying less total money to the university
- Free university, paying percentage of income, US model, not the majority of
  western.
- All western states going toward easier university, the future of our side is
  alternative, the comparative is not statuos quo and AMerica, but a broad trend
- What courses student chooses -> University will get less money, less money for
  studing english, and more STEM
- THe incentive is cut all liberal arts that dont get a lot of money
- Not everyone is cut out to be a scientist, some people want to go to social
  work, they cannot even get university in the first place, because there arent any
- Poor people, who want lower paying jobs
- Incentive to pursua a low paying job after going to university, paying less,
  30 years down the hose, when you get free of debt in the current system, you
  get less money over all
- Screw university budget, university funding stream is increadibley volative,
  you cut spaces, less tuition places, they dont provice more access to
  university.
* DPM
- Taxed 15% of a high income
- Uniformed paying are unjistified, people get different levels of acces to
  unviersity, access to resources, born into richer families, ability understand
  social interactions, more use to resources university provides
- Dont get the same access, shouldnt pay to the same degree
- We tend to pay higher on tax if you get more money
- Get cut from most elite universities(?), who side provides more resources to
  the low life individuals
- You cant fiat things that are not in the status quo, huge amoiunt of pushback
  to free educations
- Average across indiduals, instead of less to low income individuals
- POI: Why can you fiat a specific version of this, instead of most likely income
- A lot of people cannot afford to go to these places, you dont know if you will
  be better off -> If i work fast food the money will definetly come,
  unviersitty no
- They will not have a debt burden
- Dont go to bankruptcy.
- Now university are craded to individuals need to these individuals.
- Maybe some rich kids, but disproportianly, rich people social upbringing to
  investment banking
- They talk about law school like its something realistic for these people,
  these guy are in fantasy land that only provide for rich kids
- Social work still some demand, a lot of people you will get a lot of money,
  donations and shit like that
* DLO
- Its not a this house would motion
- OPening governemt world -> If you want to stop debt burdens there are a bunch
  of these, progressive taxation, get more money to poor people, government
  subsidation, this is the status quo
- You are paying on a need basis, on our world you incentivize people low paying
  professions, free unpaid job, gigantically incentivize people low paying jobs
- Universities get way less money, how the UK fixes this problem -> Max
  government subsidazition -> They cant fiat government subsidies with that
- University go bankrupt, get money to no one
- Only provide programs that guarante they get money back, harder to get in,
  school teaching standards lower
- University hugely decrease spending in advance.
- Not percentage of income, the richer are only people
- POI:Different pension plans -> State is not stepping in
- POI: More socially productive -> Like internships
- Force people into subjects, forced into options
- Just not value for money, charging you based on quality of value
* MG
- Underfunded, because they dont chage enough money, or no tuition, or they are
  too expensive, we agree OG model.
- Flat rate
- Tax the rich, benefit from the system
- Global access -> Even when there is free tuition, after i graduated, or should
  i just work, there is a huge pressure to get a college degreee. Parents,
  wasting your time
- Calculus, you can go back again, get a second degree
- POI: Why shoudl a university, be not in a position to opt out of -> Schools
  funnel massive money of liberal arts to STEM, majority of these people are art
  students, make degree more employable(Arts), you are incentivize these jobs to
  make something people like -> Incentive to university to make you get
  money(Interneships, coouts, parternshsip with cooperatiosn)
- Funding mechanism, if a poor people get rich from this then help people out
- You know how much money you are getting from current graduates
- Giant oversupply teachers and social workers
- Relieve the debt burden of a unpaid internship
* MO
- Tuition is charged at all -> Is not a form of progresive tax
- Once inside tertiary education you are in a safe bubble
- Its you complete desire and complete choices
- All of these people are smarts
- Sucess is based on your choices
- Sucees is based on oportunities, everybody get, success is not your doing,
  individual is suceesful based on your
- You are cripling success, based on a arbitrary method of
- People who had bad decisions, moral obligation should exist for everybody, its
  your fault
- People still want good jobs, you are just taxing
- They overvalue self-fulfiment, zero sum game, even if its important to your,
  is not free, you have to pay for the self-fulfiment.
- Jobs need to become more emploable, privilege of poor, the fact that they are
  in college means they have some privilege
- Somethings are just not employable, AI like somes year ago, in the process
  making jobs employable you cut funds to other things, trading off research,
  remove arts.
* WHIP GOV
- Tuition is not enough
- Principle, OG tells us its principle important, Alex goes beying, how degree
  means, more and more important to get a degreee, less and less tangible,
  mandatory a degree
- Parents are telling not education, even if i dont, this is not gonna cripple
  my fgamily, not only in the united states, but in Canada
- Progressive taxation, not consistent across the board, UK good system
- Really hard to convince rich people
- Statuos quo philosoophy are cutting, high paying jobs in the fields that you
  care about
- POI: Progressive taxation shouldnt exist anyway
* WHIP OP
- Its not the university fault, different capacities, university should not be
  paying for,
- Unlikely to giver
-

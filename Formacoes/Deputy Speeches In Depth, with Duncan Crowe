* Deputy Speeches
** Introduction
More material packed in the first speech
Frontline material -> More strategic options
Presuming a high degree of material
Hung case -> Not enough material in the first speech to do a policy
** Models
*** Firt Model
Second half of Prime minister -> Aditional reasons to policy. Seeks to build
upon the arguments given to the prime minister.
*** Second model
Speeches focus more on rebuttal, more on metrics, less on provide aditional
reasons to policy.
*** How to choose
Who you trying to beat, make absolutly certain to knockout the other opening
How well the other side where
*** My parter didnt give a good model
Pointings to status quo of policy, or appealing to sense of common sense Ex: Courts
** Three aims
*** Stealing extension
Same thought process if you were extending -> Fresh perspectives. If there are
other avenues you will not develop, at least mention(more a psychologial effect)
the benefit is discouraging.
*** Providing reasons knockout opposite
**** Rebuttal, rebuttal, rebuttal
*****
Destroy line by line. Depends where is your threat. Insofar as possible turn
rebuttal into material. Substantive analysis to the opposite of the other side
claim. -> Highlight when it is responding to arguments from the other
side(Flagging)
*****
Ideally you want to make very clear the stance opening side, and demand that
closing opposition defend that stance, something implici and turn explicit.
Minimize the extent of flexibility the closing side has.
*****
Show that the other side if didnt engage, has conceded a few points. Makes as
clear as possible that they are lacking engagement and the costs of that
Show what the closing side also has to engage -> Sum of the top half
*** Deepening the analysis
Not just repeating with embelishment, fundamental reasons why something is true,
structural reasons something will be true. Pick using the material, and you can
choose.
Providing metrics, what is the comparative between the two sides, An explanation
why you material is the most important is a way to grab extension.
Given the way the motion is wording(Most difficult set of cases a proposition to
deal)
Create a story to tell judges(after learning what the opposite side is saying)
** Traps
A lot of claims in the first speech(dick move).
Analysis whole another pivot of the debate, is that fair?
** Three classic mistakes
*** All rebuttal and no substantive
Turn rebuttal on substantive, structure that way
*** Speeches do over of the first speech
Habit to break. Removes the strategic flexibility.
*** Speecher forget that are other teams
Only talk about the other top half, if the other side fucked up, dont try to
rebuttal than a lot, build substantive to win against closing teams.
** Practical matters
Good understanding of what the other side will probably say. Knowing what they
have said.
Unless if you are sure you are going split, start writing in the prime minister.
